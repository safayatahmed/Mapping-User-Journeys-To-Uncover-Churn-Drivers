# Mapping-User-Journeys-To-Uncover-Churn-Drivers

## Situation:
A high-traffic photo editing app with approximately 1 million daily active users. The main user journey — open app → select photo → edit → save — has been smooth and effective. However, recent analytics show a performance concern centered on user drop-off during the editing stage

## Problem Statement
1. A 15% churn rate occurs among users who start editing but exit before saving a photo.  
2. This drop-off occurs on a large scale, affecting a significant portion of daily users.  
3. The cause of this mid-funnel abandonment is unclear.

## Questions for Stakeholder
- If we have a technical bug/glitch in the save option feature?
- What if customers' expectations are not met by downloading it?
- What if we fail to provide enough value using the app compared to the competitors?
- Could the editing panel confuse the customers?
- What are the recent changes to the app?

## Key Insights
- User growth peaked in October, followed by a **sharp decline** in November, with the user count dropping from 558 to 228.
- During November, the platform observed a 0% return rate for first-time users, while previous months have seen return rate
- Ai Retouch has been the most used last-clicked option in user activity across free, pro, and trial subscriptions
- potential challenge is the assumption that the AI-retouch feature is primarily utilized by those with a Pro subscription, while the majority of platform users are on the free tier. This difference in feature access and user base distribution could be an unaddressed issue.
- The average user session involves 64 clicks and lasts approximately 2 minutes and 24 seconds. A notable decrease in these metrics has been observed with the introduction of version 7, suggesting that this version may contain glitches or issues that negatively affect the user experience.
